# TF2 Multi-box Helper
Fork of Null__'s "Multiboxing helper" from the lmaobox forum. This lua is to assist in MultiBoxing in Team Fortress 2 using lmaobox.net and its lua scripting API.
 
Null__ does not have any sort of github. He only uploaded his source to pastebin. Original post: https://lmaobox.net/forum/v/discussion/22760/release-multiboxing-helper

# Usage
This lua is to be run on every instance of Team Fortress 2. To run the lua, the Team Fortress 2 game client needs to be loaded with the lmaobox beta build. You can enable this build by making a shortcut to the lmaobox loader and adding -beta to the properties. You then run this shortcut with the -beta in its properties.
 
The commands you run have to be sent through partychat. You can find the command docs and arguments here: https://github.com/yoshisaac/TF2-MultiBox-Helper/wiki/Commands-Arguments-Usage
