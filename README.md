# TF2 Multi-box Helper
Fork of __Null's "Multiboxing helper" from the lmaobox forum. I give full credit to __Null, and his work for being able to parse party chat text and interpretate it using lmaobox.net lua. This lua is to assist in MultiBoxing in Team Fortress 2 using lmaobox.net and its lua scripting API.
 
__Null does not have any sort of github, or repository for his work. He only uploaded his source to pastebin. Original forum post: https://lmaobox.net/forum/v/discussion/22760/release-multiboxing-helper

# Usage
This lua is to be run on every instance of Team Fortress 2. To run the lua, the Team Fortress 2 game client needs to be loaded with the lmaobox beta build. You can enable this build by making a shortcut to the lmaobox loader and adding -beta to the properties. You then run this shortcut with the -beta in its properties.
 
A library I use in the script is Lnx00's LnxLib. To download it, either go to my releases, or go to his github: https://github.com/lnx00/Lmaobox-Library/releases
There, you can download the latest version of LnxLib, which will be more bug free when I upload updates that are not marked as release.
 
The commands you run have to be sent through partychat. You can find the command docs and arguments here: https://github.com/yoshisaac/TF2-MultiBox-Helper/wiki/Commands-Arguments-Usage

# What is MultiBoxing?
In a sense, MultiBoxing is the act of making bots. The original meaning, and where MultiBoxing originated, was in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games such as World of Warcraft (WoW). Where players would run multiple instances of their game, that all accepted inputs from the keyboard at once, allowing you to play as ten or so characters at once.
 
MultiBoxing in Team Fortress 2 is not as easy or does not work the exact same. A First Person Shooter (FPS) requires aimming a gun, which has to be a lot more accurate than a spell in a MMO. To combat this issue, all of the sandboxed instances of Team Fortress 2 have some sort of video game cheat injected. The cheat will automate following players, auto aiming at players, and a few more things. Also in Team Fortress 2, you are limited to six players in a party, waiting to be queued into a server, and the ability for players to vote kick you from the team.
